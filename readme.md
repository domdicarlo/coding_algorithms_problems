# Coding Algorithms 
## By Dominic DiCarlo

These enclosed .py files are solutions worked out by me (that I have often consulted online resources to come up with) for popular coding/math problems found in programming interviews. I have started this repo to practice coding these answers for myself, and to put them somewhere I can refer to them again while studying. I have tried to add commented explanations where appropriate. 

If they help you, fantastic!
